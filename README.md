# Mod Managers - The Sims 4

This is a simple project to organize my mods, I don't know if it's useful for everyone, I know is useful for me 'cause it makes it easier to install package of mods with lots of files in a single click.

## It handles;

- Duplicates, it won't install the same file twice. It will track if the file with the same name is being used by a different mod and keep just one copy physically.
- Manage tray files and package files for you.
- Install an entire folder at once.
- Uninstall them all at once.

## Limitations

- It does not (so far) handle zip, rar or 7z files. I'll add that later to zip and unzip folders as well.

## Roadmap

Still thinking but there's a lot of polishment to do, adjusments on performance and a better mod handle other than the treeview. Categorization, ordering, Mod toggle (enable/disable). If you have any ideas on what to implement let me know.

## Supported OS

- Windows

## Requirements

To make it work you'll need .NET 6 Desktop Runtime. (+/- 50mb download)

- [All Versions](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)

- [x64 Installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.1-windows-x64-installer)

- [x86 Installer](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.1-windows-x86-installer)

It's just faster, safer and has a better performance than .net framework alternatives. I'm thinking on moving this to a electron-based app so I'm not sure if I'll downgrade to anything prior .net 6.

Open issues for broken things, things you want and whatnot. Open a MR to add something, change or fix something.
